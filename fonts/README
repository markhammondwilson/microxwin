This directory contains some SNF fonts which are converted from X11 distribution's BDF fonts.
See ../X11/xfonts.c on how these fonts are processed. LibX11 looks for *.snf and xfonts.dir in /usr/fonts.

1. bdftosnf creates SNF format fonts from Adobe BDF fonts.
2. mkxddir creates matching xfonts.dir which is a list of available fonts.
3. copy *.snf and xfonts.dir to /usr/fonts on the target system. These fonts are used by older software
   that only use X11 core fonts.
4. If you have compiled in freetype,fontconfig, libXft, libXrender from the standard distribution. Then
   both TrueType and Type 1 fonts will be available. Command fc-list will show available fonts
5. If application only uses core X11 fonts than you only need to implement 3. Or if all applications only use
   anti-aliased fonts than you don't need to install SNF fonts.
