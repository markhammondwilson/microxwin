The gdkasync.c file is a replacement for the official gtk+-2**/gdk/x11/gdkasync.c.
This file implements equivalent functions as defined in the original file. It calls
standard Xlib functions so is compatible with both standard X11 and MicroXwin distribution.

These are the steps we use to create a replacement gdk library for example on Slackware 10.2.

1. cat /usr/lib/pkgconfig/gtk+-2.0.pc to determine exact gtk version. For Slackware 10.2 it
   shows gtk+-2.6.10.

2. As root download the version from http://www.gtk.org and untar in the home directory.

3. Replace gtk+-2**/gdk/x11/gdkasync.c with the included gdkasync.c

4 ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-debug=no
  This will create config.h and the necessary makefiles.
  
5. Comment out //#define HAVE_XSYNC 1 in config.h. We don't support this extension.

6. make will build the whole package but we only need to replace one library.
   Go to ~/gtk+-2.6.10/gdk/.libs and copy libgdk-x11-2.0.so.0.600.10 to /usr/lib. 
   For safety you can backup the original.
